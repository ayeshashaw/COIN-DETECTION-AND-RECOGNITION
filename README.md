In an increasingly digitized world where automation and efficiency are paramount, the problem of automated
coin detection and counting holds profound significance. This task involves the development
of algorithms and systems capable of accurately identifying, localizing, and quantifying coins within
digital images, with applications spanning diverse sectors such as retail, finance, robotics, and assistive
technology. The project at hand focuses on developing a Python program for coin detection within images,
employing advanced techniques from computer vision and image processing.



Certainly! The code you provided is a program to capture video from a phone's camera, process each frame to detect contours, and then estimate the total money based on the detected contours' characteristics such as area and shape. Hereâ€™s a concise explanation and some improvements to streamline it:

*Imports and Initialization:*

Import necessary libraries: cv2 for OpenCV functionalities, numpy for numerical operations, and cvzone for some high-level image processing functionalities.
Initialize global variables such as totalMoney, ColorFinder instance, and HSV values for color detection.



*Preprocessing Function:*

The preprocessing function converts an image to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, detects edges using the Canny method, and performs morphological operations to enhance the edges.


*Main Loop for Video Capture:*

Capture video from the phone's camera using its IP address.
Read frames in a loop, preprocess them, and find contours.
Based on the contours' area and circularity, classify them as different denominations of money and update the total money.
Display the processed image with the detected contours and the total money overlaid on it.
Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed.
